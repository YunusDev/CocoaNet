## General info
70% of the worldâ€™s cocoa beans come from four West African countries: Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. Cocoa is the chief agricultural export of Ghana and Ghana's main cash crop. However there are numerous infections that are crippling cocoa production. 

The purpose of this project is to develop an image classification system that would be able to analyse cocoa images and detect the presence of infections.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Python 3.6+
* Pytorch 1.0

## Infections
The model is currently able to identify these infections:
* Black Pod 

Support for these infections will be added:
* Swollen Shoot
